# OSBRAIN: A GENERAL-PURPOSE MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM MODULE

### MIGUEL SÁNCHEZ DE LEÓN PEQUE
#### Language: EN
## Description

osBrain is a general-purpose multi-agent system module written in Python. It
uses ØMQ for message passing and Pyro4 for easy deployment and configuration.

osBrain was initially developed in OpenSistemas based on the need to create a
real-time automated-trading platform. This platform needed to be able to
process real-time market data updates fast and in parallel. Robustness was
very important as well in order to prevent active trading strategies from
being affected by a failure in another strategy.

Python was chosen for being a great language for fast prototyping and for
having a huge data analysis ecosystem available. It was kept for its final
performance and the beautiful source code created with it.
